    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we show you how to:\n",
    "- Define a tool that the LLM can reliably call that produces JSON output\n",
    "- Use the googlesearch and wikipedia python modules to search the internet if the LLM cannot answer a research question itself\n",
    "- Rerank the search results options from best to worst\n",
    "- Scrape and process the best option HTML page to create context for the LLM\n",

    "We will use Bedrock's `Claude 3 Sonnet`, `Claude 3.5 Sonnet`(default), and `Claude 3 Haiku` base model using the AWS boto3 SDK. \n",

    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- This notebook requires permissions to access Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Ensure you have gone to the Bedrock models access page in the AWS Console and enabled access to `Anthropic Claude 3 Sonnet`\n",

    "> AmazonBedrockFullAccess\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use case\n",
    "You are building a research assistant GenAI application. In some cases the user's question may be about an event, product, or service that is more recent than the cutoff training date for the LLM model or not within the model's knowledge. For these cases, we want the LLM model to call the internet search tool to gather context relating to the question. Then we can supply that context back to the LLM to answer the question. "

The BQ continues to hold 30% in Quebec.As in previous surveys, every party\\u2019s vote share remains consistent, with very minor changes, as the Conservatives are down 1 and the Liberals are up 2, all within the margin of error.Regionally, the Conservatives continue to lead across all regions. In our last survey, the Conservatives and the BQ were statistically tied in QC. The story is very much the same although we have the Liberals and BQ now statistically tied with the Conservatives three points back.Learn about the game-changing tool from the Abacus Data team that makes it possible to estimate polling results to the riding level for improve advocacy and government relations.Demographically, the Conservatives continue to lead among all groups, as vote intention remains relatively stable. Conservative support remains high at 42% among 30-to-44 (1 point down from our last survey) and 43% among 60-and-over (1 point up).Conservative support among 18-to-29 remains unchanged, while support among those 45-to-59 is down 4 points, as support for the NDP shifts slightly from the last survey (3 points up).For the last two waves of tracking, there is a slight gender gap in Conservative support. 47% of men would vote Conservative compared with 38% of women. Liberal support is consistent between men and women while NDP support is 6-points higher among women than among men.Desire for change has also increased slightly. 86% want change (up 3 points), with 55% believing there\\u2019s a good alternative to the Liberals (up 2 points). \\u00a0Only 14% of Canadians believe that Justin Trudeau and the Liberals deserve to be re-elected.This desire for change is also reflected on impressions of Justin Trudeau which remain negative. After a summer of travels across the country, the overall image of the Prime Minister is the same as it was when the summer started. Today, 24% (down one point) have a positive view of the Prime Minister, while 59% (up 1 point) have a negative impression of the Prime Minister, for a net score of -35.In contrast, impressions of Pierre Poilievre remain in the net favourable territory. 40% of Canadians have a positive impression of Mr. Poilievre, while 35% have a negative impression, for a net score of +5.In our last survey, 37% had a negative impression of NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, the highest we have recorded. Today, impressions have improved slightly, although the shift remains within the margin of error, as 35% have a negative impression. Positive impressions hold at 33%, for a net score sore of -2.Voting for the Conservative Party\\u2026and against Justin TrudeauIn this edition we also asked current Conservative Party supporters whether their motivation to vote Conservative was more about liking Mr. Poilievre and the Conservatives or more about disliking Mr. Trudeau and the Liberals. Very much reflective of Justin Trudeau\\u2019s negative impressions, we find that 40% of Conservative supporters say their vote is more about disliking the Prime Minister and the Liberals than liking the Conservative.More strikingly, of those who voted Liberal in the 2021 election and who would vote Conservative today, 50% say their support is more impacted by their dislike for Trudeau and the Liberals than their affinity for the Conservatives. We also see a that dislike of the Liberals or Mr. Trudeau can even override someone\\u2019s dislike or lack of affinity for Mr. Poilievre. 65% of those whose impression of Mr. Poilievre is neutral or negative and plan to vote Conservative say it is because they dislike the Liberals and Mr. Trudeau.When asked in a follow-up question, how Conservative supporters would react if Prime Minister Trudeau stepped down as Liberal leader, 68% said they would still vote Conservative, \\u201cno matter what\\u201d. Another 19% say they would probably still vote Conservative but could change their mind. Only 9% would be willing to consider voting Liberal depending on who the new leader is, and none say they would likely vote Liberal if Trudeau stepped down as leader.Even among those who are motivated to vote for the Conservative Party out of dislike for Trudeau and the Liberals, only 156 would consider voting Liberal if Trudeau stepped down and depending on who was elected leader. This suggests that Trudeau stepping away may not immediately solve the Liberal Party\\u2019s problems, but it may allow a new leader to try and persuade people.For context, those current Conservatives who might consider voting Liberal depending on who a new Liberal leader might be represents 3% of the electorate. Another 7% say they could change their mind away from the Conservatives. That\\u2019s a sizeable portion of the electorate.Find out more about the The Three Threads and how the Abacus Data team looks at polling for public affairs and advocacy.We also posed the same question to individuals who indicated they would vote for the NDP if the election were held today. In contrast to Conservative supporters, NDP supporters are more likely to be motivated by their positive view of Jagmeet Singh and/or the NDP itself, with 79% citing this as their main reason. Only 21% of current NDP supporters are motivated by a dislike of the Liberals.In term of strategic voting, we asked NDP supporters what would happen if it looked like Mr. Poilievre, and the Conservatives were likely to win the election if the NDP and the Liberals split the vote. 41% said they would still vote for the NDP, while 21% might consider voting Liberal to defeat a Conservative candidate.Strategic voting increases among those who hold very negative impressions of Poilievre (with 38%).We also wanted to gauge the possibility of strategic voting. We asked current NDP, Green and BQ supporters the likelihood of them voting Liberal, if it became clear that the Liberal Party had the best chance of stopping the Conservatives from winning the election. We find that 8% of committed of the electorate or 32% of NDP, Green, and BQ voters say they would probably vote Liberal, while 3% of the committed electorate or 14% of NDP, Green, and BQ say they would definitely vote Liberal. If all 11% of these voters switched to the Liberals, the 17-point Conservative lead would shrink to 6-points.And as we showed earlier, if Prime Minister Trudeau stepped aside, the combination of a new leader and strategic voting could make the election far closer than it appears now. But the odds of that remain quite low, based on our polling.Interestingly when we asked the likelihood of current Liberal, Green and BQ supporters voting NDP, if it became clear that the NDP had the best chance of stopping the Conservatives from winning the election, we find that 11% of committed voters or 35% of Liberal, Green, and BQ supporters would probably vote NDP, while 6% of the committed electorate or 20% of Liberal, Green, and BQ supporters would definitely vote NDP. If the definitely and probably groups did switch to the NDP, the NDP vote share would rise from 18% to 35%, 7-points behind the Conservatives.According to Abacus Data CEO David Coletto: \\u201cThe overall aspects of political opinion in Canada remain very consistent and have remained so for the whole spring and summer. The Conservatives lead by a wide-margin, impressions of Pierre Poilievre remain substantially more positive than Justin Trudeau, and the desire for change is broad and fairly deep. These are the fundamentals of Canadian public opinion today.But underneath these attributes, our polling this week does indicate the possibility for change if circumstances change.If Justin Trudeau were to step aside, the Liberals would not instantly leap into contention. But enough current Conservative supporters say they might be persuaded to vote Liberal if that were to happen,Moreover, the possibility of strategic voting remains. We know from previous polling that Canadians increasingly believe that Poilievre and the Conservatives will win the next election. But there is less clarity on which party (Liberal or NDP) has the better chance at defeating them. If that view crystalizes, we show that a sizeable portion of voters in the Liberal, NDP, Green, and BQ voter universe could coalesce around one option and if the Liberals change leaders, that could drive some current Conservatives into the new leaders arms.Now this is all hypothetical and depends on several variables we can\\u2019t easily measure or gauge.What is clear, and has been for over a year now, the most likely outcome after the next election is a change in government. The Conservative Party\\u2019s lead is truly national, and crosses all demographics. But that lead is built on 4 in 10 of its supporters being motivated more by rejecting the government than embracing the alternative. There is still space for that outcome to change, no matter how unlikely it might be.\\u201dThe survey was conducted with 2,300 Canadian adults from August 14 to 18, 2024.

See Item 1A of Part I \\u2014 \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d As used herein,\\n\\u201cAmazon.com,\\u201d \\u201cwe,\\u201d \\u201cour,\\u201d and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates\\notherwise.\\nGeneral\\nWe seek to be Earth\\u2019s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than\\ncompetitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our\\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators,\\nadvertisers, and employees.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services\\n(\\u201cAWS\\u201d). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations.\\nInformation on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 10 \\u2014\\nSegment Information.\\u201d\\nConsumers\\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design\\nour stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product\\ncategories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically\\nvisiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink,\\nand eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-\\nto-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a\\nmembership program that includes fast, free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series,\\nand other benefits.\\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks\\nthat we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores.\\nWe operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I,\\n\\u201cProperties.\\u201d\\nSellers\\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using\\nour services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity\\nfees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\\nDevelopers and Enterprises\\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions,\\nthrough AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and\\nmachine learning, and other services.\\nContent Creators\\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app\\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content.\\nAdvertisers\\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored\\nads, display, and video advertising.\\n3Competition\\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide\\nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from\\nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and\\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to\\nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and\\nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online\\nand app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other\\nretailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales,\\ninventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that\\nprovide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that\\nprovide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services;\\n(7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8)\\ncompanies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether\\nin digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and\\nconvenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include\\nthe quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers\\u2019 ability and willingness to change business\\npractices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand\\nrecognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers,\\nadopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to\\ntheir own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology,\\ninfrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances\\nthe ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid\\nchange and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also\\nmay enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary\\ntechnologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law,\\ntrade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to\\nprotect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain\\nnames, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications\\ncovering certain of our proprietary technology.\\nSeasonality\\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter,\\nwhich ends December 31.\\nHuman Capital\\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth\\u2019s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2023, we\\nemployed approximately 1,525,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and\\ntemporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software\\nengineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for\\npersonnel across other parts of our business.\\nAs we strive to be Earth\\u2019s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and\\nengagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and\\ninvent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills\\ntraining and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees) and the Amazon\\nTechnical Academy (software development engineer training). Over 175,000 Amazon employees around the world have\\nparticipated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and\\nretain our employees to promote equity for all candidates and employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at\\nAmazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety\\ncontrols, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex\\nproblems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and\\nhave deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\\n4Available Information\\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding\\ninformation about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\\u201cSEC\\u201d), corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct\\nand Ethics), and select press releases.\\nExecutive Officers and Directors\\nThe following tables set forth certain information regarding our Executive Officers and Directors as of January 24, 2024:\\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\\nName Age Position\\nJeffrey P.

Risk Factors\\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an\\ninvestment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may\\nor may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth,\\nreputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows,\\nliquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by\\nfactors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant\\nrisks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of\\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations,\\u201d and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and\\nadditional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below.\\nMany of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on us.\\nBusiness and Industry Risks\\nWe Face Intense Competition\\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies,\\nincluding cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-\\ncommerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and\\ntransportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories,\\nmore customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer\\ngeographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to\\ntechnology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and\\nwell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in\\nother market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including\\nsearch, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital\\ncontent, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison\\nshopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of\\ncompetition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be\\nrequired to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or\\nservice offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if\\ncustomers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or\\nquality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations,\\nand we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often\\nsignificant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the\\n6value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for\\na variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully\\nplan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In\\ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-\\nmarket advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and\\npromote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of\\nrisks, including:\\n\\u2022 local economic and political conditions;\\n\\u2022 government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive\\ngovernmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and\\ntariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components);\\nnationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\\n\\u2022 restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products,\\nservices, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal\\nprecedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media\\nproducts and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\\n\\u2022 business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\\n\\u2022 limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\\n\\u2022 limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\\n\\u2022 shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\\n\\u2022 laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security,\\nconsumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\\n\\u2022 lower levels of use of the internet;\\n\\u2022 lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\\n\\u2022 lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\\n\\u2022 difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural\\ndifferences;\\n\\u2022 different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\\n\\u2022 compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting\\ncorrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\\n\\u2022 laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\\n\\u2022 geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will\\nintensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive\\nadvantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local\\nbrand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.\\nThe People\\u2019s Republic of China (\\u201cPRC\\u201d) and India regulate Amazon\\u2019s and its affiliates\\u2019 businesses and operations in\\ncountry through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT\\ninfrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products\\nand services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide\\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide\\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online\\nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-\\nparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a\\nthird-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing\\nlaws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in\\n7their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial\\nuncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will\\nultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to\\ncontinue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships\\nwe or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the\\ninterpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other\\nfinancial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.\\nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising\\nrevenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade\\nrestrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors\\nnegatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.\\nThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality,\\npromotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary\\nfears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a\\nresult of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur\\nduring our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet\\ncustomer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be\\nrequired to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce\\nprofitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and\\nadditional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our\\nwebsites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites\\nunavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the\\nattractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and\\ncustomer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-\\nsourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network\\noptimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.\\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\\nbalances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing\\nactivities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there\\nis also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales.\\nOur accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid,\\nresulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\\nWe Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have\\nin the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we\\nmaintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers\\nnever receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers\\u2019 descriptions,\\nand to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling\\ngoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When\\nthese policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation\\nand we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may\\nreimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of\\nthis program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results.\\nWe Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing\\nIntellectual Property Rights of Third Parties\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and\\nsimilar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret\\nprotection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary\\nrights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made\\navailable. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business.\\nFurthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be\\n8unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our\\ntrademarks and other proprietary rights.\\nWe are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions\\ntaken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or\\nreputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\\nMoreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third\\nparties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently\\ndevelop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged\\ninfringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past,\\nand may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or\\nsignificant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who\\nallege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks\\nhave been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and\\nour customers\\u2019 use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those\\nbased on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital\\ncontent. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and\\ncontent providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.\\nWe Have Foreign Exchange Risk\\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and\\nproduct and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may\\ndiffer materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany\\nbalances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also\\nhold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and\\nJapanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\\nbalances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.\\nOperating Risks\\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service\\nofferings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our\\nbusiness can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial\\nresources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage\\ngrowth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\nWe Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales\\nestimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending\\nquickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating\\nprofit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our\\nbusiness is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of\\ndemand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in\\ndecreased revenue or growth.\\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in\\nthis section and the following:\\n\\u2022 our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers\\u2019\\ndemands;\\n\\u2022 our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\\n\\u2022 our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\\n\\u2022 the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\\n9\\u2022 changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including\\noutside the U.S.;\\n\\u2022 timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\\n\\u2022 the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\\n\\u2022 the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\\n\\u2022 the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief\\nand could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;\\n\\u2022 variations in the mix of products and services we sell;\\n\\u2022 variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\\n\\u2022 the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional\\nbenefits to our customers;\\n\\u2022 factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or\\ncommitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics), and public perceptions\\nregarding social or ethical issues related to our development and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning\\ntechnologies, products, and services;\\n\\u2022 the extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\\n\\u2022 availability of and increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), resources such as land, water, and energy,\\ncommodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products,\\nincluding as a result of inflationary pressures;\\n\\u2022 constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;\\n\\u2022 the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant\\nour customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;\\n\\u2022 our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\\n\\u2022 the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to\\ncustomize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;\\n\\u2022 the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of\\nservice attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events;\\n\\u2022 the extent to which we fail to maintain our unique culture of innovation, customer obsession, and long-term thinking,\\nwhich has been critical to our growth and success;\\n\\u2022 disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a\\nresult of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks, armed hostilities, and\\npolitical conflicts, including those involving China), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental\\nactions impacting us, our customers, and our third-party sellers and suppliers in China or other foreign countries), and\\nsimilar events; and\\n\\u2022 potential negative impacts of climate change, including: increased operating costs due to more frequent extreme\\nweather events or climate-related changes, such as rising temperatures and water scarcity; increased investment\\nrequirements associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy; decreased demand for our products and\\nservices as a result of changes in customer behavior; increased compliance costs due to more extensive and global\\nregulations and third-party requirements; and reputational damage resulting from perceptions of our environmental\\nimpact.\\nWe Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers\\nFailures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our\\nfulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center\\ncapacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As\\nwe continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and\\ndata center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance\\nthat we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\\n10In addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping\\ncost by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-\\nsourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity\\nacross our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it\\ndifficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would\\nlike.\\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the\\ncomplexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for\\nstorage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory\\nfulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to\\noptimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An\\ninability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties\\nexperienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and\\nrelated costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound\\ninventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused\\ndisasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and\\nsecurity issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.\\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive,\\nproprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access,\\nor other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors\\u2019 or customers\\u2019 technology, products, and systems,\\ncould: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating\\nresults; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data\\nsecurity, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services;\\nand otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including,\\nwithout limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office\\nsupport, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse\\neffects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect\\ncustomer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at\\na third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be\\ncircumvented.\\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to\\nrespond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which\\nmay reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware,\\nupgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to\\navoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.\\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or\\ninterrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather\\n(including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed\\nhostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and\\nsimilar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could\\nprevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service\\nofferings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may\\nnot be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these\\nevents could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel\\nCould Negatively Affect Our Business\\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have \\u201ckey\\nperson\\u201d life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the\\nindustries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience\\n11significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical\\nstaff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our\\nemployees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies\\u2019 policies, which could negatively impact our\\nability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to\\nsuccessfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry\\nout our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain\\nour operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and\\nregulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs,\\ndecrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our\\nworkforce.\\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational\\nefforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our\\nresponse to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation.\\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of\\nsupply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and\\ncontent. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content,\\ncomponents, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit\\nor stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery,\\nincluding as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-\\ncaused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to\\nprocure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, we\\nrely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence\\ninfrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our\\nability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers\\nor other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain\\nStandards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our\\nreputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through\\ncommercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services,\\ntechnology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services\\nthrough our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other\\nresource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain,\\nand develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service,\\ninventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third\\nparties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially\\ndependent on the volume of the other company\\u2019s sales. Therefore, when the other company\\u2019s offerings are not successful, the\\ncompensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to\\nenter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject\\nto claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or\\ndeveloping these services.\\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We\\nmay in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their\\ncontractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.\\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such\\nas:\\n\\u2022 disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\\n\\u2022 impairment of other relationships;\\n\\u2022 variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\\n\\u2022 difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\\n12Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments\\nWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint\\nventures with additional companies. These transactions involve risks such as:\\n\\u2022 disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\\n\\u2022 problems retaining key personnel;\\n\\u2022 additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\\n\\u2022 the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\\n\\u2022 the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or\\nour own customers as a result of any integration of operations;\\n\\u2022 the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing\\nconditions, and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;\\n\\u2022 the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated\\nexpenses related to such integration;\\n\\u2022 the difficulty of integrating a new company\\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data\\nsecurity, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if\\nsuch integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;\\n\\u2022 losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee\\u2019s\\nfinancial performance into our financial results;\\n\\u2022 for investments in which an investee\\u2019s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or\\nin part, or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the\\ndependence on the investee\\u2019s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;\\n\\u2022 the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger\\npublic company;\\n\\u2022 the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the\\nrisks our other businesses face;\\n\\u2022 potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\\n\\u2022 for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and\\nlanguages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\\nAs a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur\\ndebt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and\\nharm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and\\nstrategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-\\nthan-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.\\nWe Face Significant Inventory Risk\\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us\\nand third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of\\nseasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer\\ndemand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors.\\nWe endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell.\\nDemand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of\\nsale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service, it may be difficult to\\nestablish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The\\nacquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be\\nreturnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at\\ntimes we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of\\nthe inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.\\nWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional\\nfinancing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer\\u2019s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment\\n13upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become\\nsubject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication\\nprocesses that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For\\ncertain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time\\nand raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment\\nmethods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and\\npromotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide\\nthese services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if\\nrenewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data\\nsecurity rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted\\nto make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach,\\ncompromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our\\nbeing liable for card issuing banks\\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and\\ndebit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our\\nbusiness and operating results could be adversely affected.\\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances\\nwith us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their\\nbehalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use,\\nhandling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We\\nare also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering,\\ninternational money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer\\nprotection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be\\nsubject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\\nWe Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response\\nto, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\\n\\u2022 changes in interest rates;\\n\\u2022 conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\\n\\u2022 quarterly variations in operating results;\\n\\u2022 fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\\n\\u2022 changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\\n\\u2022 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\\n\\u2022 changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\\n\\u2022 changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\\n\\u2022 transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.\\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our\\ncash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results\\nor reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\\nGovernment Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\\ninternet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial\\nintelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover\\ntaxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, pricing,\\ncontent, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste,\\nenergy consumption, environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition,\\nemployment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing,\\nand information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and\\noperation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services,\\nproduct labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how\\n14existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data\\nlocalization, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet, e-commerce,\\ndigital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large\\nnumber of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding\\nas the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other\\nproceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and\\nnovel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects\\nof our operations infringe competition rules, including aspects of Amazon\\u2019s operation of its stores including its fulfillment\\nnetwork, Amazon\\u2019s acquisitions, and certain aspects of AWS\\u2019s offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute these claims and\\nintend to defend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of\\nlaws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve,\\nleading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are\\nincreasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have\\ncharacterized to be online \\u201cgatekeepers\\u201d through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new\\nregulations and laws, which increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations,\\nlaws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries,\\ninvestigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to\\nunanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or\\navailability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a\\nmanner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on\\nour operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks.\\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of\\nOperations\\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we\\nare regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including\\nproceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual\\nproperty matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust,\\nprivacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes,\\ngoods and services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), and other\\nmatters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and\\ngeographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more\\npeople, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating\\na number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state\\nattorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us\\nbecause of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors.\\nThe outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves\\nor possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable\\noutcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such\\namounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a\\nmaterial effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible\\nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions,\\nconsent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or\\nservices, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of\\nnon-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on\\nour operations.\\nWe Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or\\nManufacture\\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal\\ninjury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who\\nsell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee,\\nwe may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party\\nseller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain\\nliability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will\\ncontinue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that\\nare intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for\\n15breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from\\nproduct liability.\\nWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign\\njurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for\\ntax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to\\ntax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions.\\nSuch changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions\\nare considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes,\\ntargeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect\\nsales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result\\nin liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising\\nand marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader\\ninternational tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we\\noperate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense in future years.\\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or\\nretroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to\\nprovide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government\\nagencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly\\ncomply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions,\\ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,\\nlosses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or\\nextraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income\\nand loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the\\nordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is\\nuncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us.\\nDevelopments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash\\nflows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the\\ninherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial,\\nadministrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially\\ndifferent from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to\\nAmazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay\\nadditional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the\\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we\\nbelieve our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be\\nmaterially different from our historical tax accruals.\\nWe Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement\\nregulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and\\ninvestigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and\\nadministrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment\\nof fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to\\nperiodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\\nWe have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from potential unauthorized\\noccurrences on or through our electronic information systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or\\navailability of our information systems or the information residing on those systems. These include a wide variety of\\n16mechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems, and other processes that are designed to prevent, detect, or mitigate data\\nloss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data include\\nconfidential, proprietary, and business and personal information that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our\\nbusiness, including on behalf of third parties. We also use systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security\\nincident at a third-party vendor or customer. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify material risks from\\ncybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems we use\\nfor encryption and authentication; employee email; content delivery to customers; back-office support; and other functions.\\nAs part of our risk management process, we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management,\\npenetration testing, security audits, and ongoing risk assessments. We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are\\nutilized when incidents are detected. We require employees with access to information systems, including all corporate\\nemployees, to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.\\nWe have a unified and centrally-coordinated team, led by our chief security officer, that is responsible for implementing\\nand maintaining centralized cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership\\nand other teams across Amazon. Reporting to our chief security officer are a number of experienced chief information security\\nofficers responsible for various parts of our business, including AWS, each of whom is supported by a team of trained\\ncybersecurity professionals. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage assessors,\\nconsultants, auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks.\\nOur cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership, including as part of our enterprise\\nrisk assessments that are reviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Such risks and mitigations are also\\nsubject to oversight by the Security Committee of our Board of Directors. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we\\nface is discussed in Item 1A of Part I, \\u201cRisk Factors,\\u201d under the heading \\u201cWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security\\nBreaches,\\u201d which should be read in conjunction with the information above.\\nThe Security Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees our policies and procedures for\\nprotecting our cybersecurity infrastructure and for compliance with applicable data protection and security regulations, and\\nrelated risks. The Security Committee receives reports regarding such risks from management, including our chief security\\nofficer, and reports to the Board at least annually. The Security Committee also oversees the Board\\u2019s response to any significant\\ncybersecurity incidents.\\nOur chief security officer, who has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from over 15 years of work\\nexperience on the security team at Amazon and an extensive career in the technology and cybersecurity industries as a senior\\nexecutive in the federal government, heads the team responsible for implementing and maintaining cybersecurity and data\\nprotection practices at Amazon and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\\n17Item 2.

Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nForward-Looking Statements\\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities\\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance,\\nindustry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-\\nlooking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-\\nlooking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain.\\nActual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign\\nexchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional\\nlabor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and\\nemerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments,\\nthe mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the\\nextent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results,\\ninternational growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings,\\nfulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree\\nto which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic\\ntransactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical\\nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks.\\nThese risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ\\nsignificantly from management\\u2019s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nOverview\\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered\\nthrough our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers,\\nand we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from\\nitems we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as\\nservice sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product\\ncategories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing,\\nand digital content subscriptions.\\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by\\nincreasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital\\nexpenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily\\nresult from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by\\ninvestments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer\\nexperience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including\\nlowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original\\ncontent, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving\\nreliability, and earning customer trust. See \\u201cResults of Operations \\u2014 Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\u201d below for additional\\ninformation on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product\\nand content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment,\\ntransportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs\\ninclude the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online\\nstores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs\\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs,\\ngeographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to\\nlower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our\\nprocesses. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\\nWe seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due.\\nBecause consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect\\nvariability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales\\nby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings,\\nsupply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent\\nto which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over\\ntime since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix\\n20of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and\\ntiming of payment terms with suppliers.\\nWe expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers,\\nsoftware and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital\\nspending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-\\nfunctionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure,\\nincluding AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to\\nenhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the\\nspeed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical\\napplications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users\\u2019 experience on the internet and\\nincrease its ubiquity in people\\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in\\nAWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine\\nlearning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy\\ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite\\nnetwork for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes,\\nsuch as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders\\u2019 interests. We utilize restricted stock\\nunits as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests\\nof our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards\\noutstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.6 billion\\nand 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our\\nreported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our\\ninternational locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained\\nconstant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our\\nconsolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our\\nincreasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders\\nover the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of\\ncurrency changes.\\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the\\neffect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either\\npositively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and\\nSupplementary Data \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.\\u201d\\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our\\nfinancial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 in Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\u201d\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States\\n(\\u201cGAAP\\u201d) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses,\\nand related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical\\naccounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation\\nuncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of\\nthe Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have\\nother key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014\\nNote 1 \\u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.\\u201d Although we believe that our\\nestimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may\\ndiffer significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and\\nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently\\navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product\\n21vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future\\ndisposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material\\nwrite-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of\\nDecember 31, 2023, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $355 million.\\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These\\ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations,\\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or\\nwithout notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and\\nestimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of\\nbusiness for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to\\nchange due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use\\nour deferred tax assets.\\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions,\\ninvestments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,\\nincluding earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated\\nin jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related\\ntax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to\\nour forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to\\ntax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In\\naddition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate\\nmultinationals.\\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional\\nincome tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect\\non our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and\\nsubsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the\\nadequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations,\\nand any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2023\\nCash provided by (used in):\\nOperating activities $ 46,752 $ 84,946\\nInvesting activities (37,601) (49,833)\\nFinancing activities 9,718 (15,879)\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and\\nmarketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $70.0 billion and $86.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nAmounts held in foreign currencies were $18.3 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our foreign\\ncurrency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.\\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $46.8 billion and $84.9 billion in 2022 and 2023. Our operating cash\\nflows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and\\nadvertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and\\nrelated transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities\\ngenerally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2023, compared to the prior year, was due to an\\nincrease in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific\\npoint in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the\\ntiming of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold\\nimprovements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for\\n22acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable\\nsecurities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(37.6) billion and $(49.8) billion in 2022 and 2023, with the\\nvariability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash\\ncapital expenditures were $58.3 billion, and $48.1 billion in 2022 and 2023, which primarily reflect investments in technology\\ninfrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment\\nnetwork, which investments we expect to increase in 2024. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition\\nand other investment activity of $8.3 billion and $5.8 billion in 2022 and 2023. We funded the acquisitions of MGM Holdings\\nInc. in 2022 and 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a note\\nfrom Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible into equity. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an\\nadditional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.\\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $9.7 billion and $(15.9) billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash inflows from\\nfinancing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $62.7 billion and $18.1 billion\\nin 2022 and 2023. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock in 2022, payments of\\nshort-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $53.0 billion and $34.0 billion in 2022\\nand 2023. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $675 million and $642 million in 2022 and 2023.\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs,\\nwe had $682 million of borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility, and the entire amount of the term\\nloan has been repaid as of December 31, 2023. See Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 6\\n\\u2014 Debt\\u201d for additional information.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $4.7\\nbillion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,\\nindefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of\\nsuch amounts.\\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized\\nresearch and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to\\nexpense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually\\nfrom 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated depreciation deduction election for 2021, and\\na full election for 2022 and 2023. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to\\nbe capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal\\nand state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $6.0 billion and $11.2 billion for 2022 and 2023.\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $365 million and\\n$503 million. See Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 6 \\u2014 Debt\\u201d and \\u201cFinancial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 7 \\u2014 Commitments and Contingencies\\u201d for additional discussion of our principal\\ncontractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders,\\nincluding for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve\\nmonths. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual\\nprovisions.\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances,\\nas well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next\\ntwelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See\\nItem 1A of Part I, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit\\nfacilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay\\ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial\\nposition.\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will,\\nfrom time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital\\ninfrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or\\nissue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be\\navailable in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking\\nbodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in\\nour borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.\\n23Results of Operations\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect\\nthe way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 10 \\u2014 Segment Information.\\u201d\\nOverview\\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility,\\nand global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are\\ndifficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, changes in fuel, utility, and food costs, interest rates, and economic outlook may\\nimpact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also expect the current macroeconomic\\nenvironment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or all\\nof these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2024.\\nNet Sales\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping\\nfees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which\\nincludes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime\\nmembership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2023\\nNet Sales:\\nNorth America $ 315,880 $ 352,828\\nInternational 118,007 131,200\\nAWS 80,096 90,757\\nConsolidated $ 513,983 $ 574,785\\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):\\nNorth America 13 % 12 %\\nInternational (8) 11\\nAWS 29 13\\nConsolidated 9 12\\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:\\nNorth America 13 % 12 %\\nInternational 4 11\\nAWS 29 13\\nConsolidated 13 12\\nNet Sales Mix:\\nNorth America 61 % 61 %\\nInternational 23 23\\nAWS 16 16\\nConsolidated 100 % 100 %\\nSales increased 12% in 2023, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced net sales by\\n$71 million in 2023. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see \\u201cEffect of Foreign Exchange\\nRates\\u201d below.\\nNorth America sales increased 12% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased\\nunit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely\\nby our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers.\\nInternational sales increased 11% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit\\nsales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by\\nour continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. Changes in\\nforeign exchange rates increased International net sales by $88 million in 2023.\\n24AWS sales increased 13% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer\\nusage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.\\nOperating Income (Loss)\\nOperating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2023\\nOperating Income (Loss)\\nNorth America $ (2,847) $ 14,877\\nInternational (7,746) (2,656)\\nAWS 22,841 24,631\\nConsolidated $ 12,248 $ 36,852\\nOperating income was $12.2 billion and $36.9 billion for 2022 and 2023. We believe that operating income is a more\\nmeaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.\\nThe North America operating income in 2023, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to\\nincreased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs and increased\\ntechnology and infrastructure costs.\\nThe decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to\\nincreased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs and increased\\ntechnology and infrastructure costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by $246 million in\\n2023.\\nThe increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to\\nincreased sales, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of\\nwhich were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates\\npositively impacted operating income by $220 million in 2023.\\n25Operating Expenses\\nInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2023\\nOperating Expenses:\\nCost of sales $ 288,831 $ 304,739\\nFulfillment 84,299 90,619\\nTechnology and infrastructure 73,213 85,622\\nSales and marketing 42,238 44,370\\nGeneral and administrative 11,891 11,816\\nOther operating expense (income), net 1,263 767\\nTotal operating expenses $ 501,735 $ 537,933\\nYear-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline):\\nCost of sales 6 % 6 %\\nFulfillment 12 7\\nTechnology and infrastructure 31 17\\nSales and marketing 30 5\\nGeneral and administrative 35 (1)\\nOther operating expense (income), net 1,936 (39)\\nPercent of Net Sales:\\nCost of sales 56.2 % 53.0 %\\nFulfillment 16.4 15.8\\nTechnology and infrastructure 14.2 14.9\\nSales and marketing 8.2 7.7\\nGeneral and administrative 2.3 2.1\\nOther operating expense (income), net 0.2 0.1\\nCost of Sales\\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs,\\nincluding costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media\\ncontent costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.\\nThe increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product\\nand shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies and lower transportation\\nrates. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $254 million in 2023.\\nShipping costs were $83.5 billion and $89.5 billion in 2022 and 2023. Shipping costs to receive products from our\\nsuppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our\\ncost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we\\nuse more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part\\nthrough achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and\\nachieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future\\nsuccess, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \\u201cTechnology and infrastructure\\u201d as we leverage a shared\\ninfrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\\nFulfillment\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International\\nfulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment\\nprocessing and related transaction costs are included in \\u201cFulfillment,\\u201d AWS costs are primarily classified as \\u201cTechnology and\\ninfrastructure.\\u201d Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and\\nrelated transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and\\n26fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and\\nphysical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold,\\nand our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements\\nto our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction\\ncosts as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase\\nprice of underlying transactions.\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased\\nsales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign\\nexchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $52 million in 2023.\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet\\nanticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the\\nfulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\\nTechnology and Infrastructure\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and\\ndevelopment of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and\\ndisplay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include\\nservers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses\\nnecessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to\\noffer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy\\ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service\\nand autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the\\ncustomer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever\\nincreasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product\\nand service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect\\nspending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs\\nare allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in 2023,\\ncompared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs\\nassociated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new\\nproducts and service offerings.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and\\nselling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of\\nmarketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third-party customer referrals, television\\nadvertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the\\nextent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we\\nwould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\\nThe increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to\\nincreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.\\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and\\nmarketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them\\nindefinitely.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative costs were $11.9 billion and $11.8 billion during 2022 and 2023, and were primarily related to\\npayroll and related expenses and professional fees.\\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\\nOther operating expense (income), net was $1.3 billion and $767 million during 2022 and 2023, and was primarily related\\nto asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in\\n2023, and the amortization of intangible assets.\\n27Interest Income and Expense\\nOur interest income was $989 million and $2.9 billion during 2022 and 2023, primarily due to an increase in prevailing\\nrates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term\\nmarketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing\\nrates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\\nInterest expense was $2.4 billion and $3.2 billion in 2022 and 2023 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases.\\nSee Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 4 \\u2014 Leases and Note 6 \\u2014 Debt\\u201d for additional\\ninformation.\\nOur long-term lease liabilities were $73.0 billion and $77.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our long-term\\ndebt was $67.1 billion and $58.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. See Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and\\nSupplementary Data \\u2014 Note 4 \\u2014 Leases and Note 6 \\u2014 Debt\\u201d for additional information.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net was $(16.8) billion and $938 million during 2022 and 2023. The primary components of\\nother income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign\\ncurrency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of\\n$(12.7) billion and $797 million from our equity investment in Rivian.\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and\\ntaxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special\\ntax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock\\nprice, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes,\\nregulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global\\ntax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or\\nlosses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-\\ntax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater\\nwhen our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is\\nuncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.\\nWe recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $(3.2) billion and $7.1 billion in 2022 and 2023. See Item 8 of Part\\nII, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 9 \\u2014 Income Taxes\\u201d for additional information.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the\\nconditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign\\nexchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.\\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on\\nthe impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.\\nFree Cash Flow\\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by \\u201cPurchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales\\nand incentives.\\u201d The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, \\u201cNet\\ncash provided by (used in) operating activities,\\u201d for 2022 and 2023 (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022 2023\\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,752 $ 84,946\\nPurchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (58,321) (48,133)\\nFree cash flow $ (11,569) $ 36,813\\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (37,601) $ (49,833)\\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 9,718 $ (15,879)\\n28Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations\\nFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by\\n\\u201cPrincipal repayments of finance leases\\u201d and \\u201cPrincipal repayments of financing obligations.\\u201d Principal repayments of finance\\nleases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations.

For example, these measures of free cash\\nflows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business\\nacquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change\\nover time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire\\nconsolidated statements of cash flows.\\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\\nInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses,\\nand operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same\\nas those in effect in the comparable prior year period.

These\\nforward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com\\u2019s expectations as of February 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial\\nuncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in\\nforeign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including\\nthe impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of\\nthe internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part\\nI, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nFirst Quarter 2024 Guidance\\n\\u2022 Net sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.5 billion, or to grow between 8% and 13% compared\\nwith first quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign\\nexchange rates.\\n\\u2022 Operating income is expected to be between $8.0 billion and $12.0 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in first quarter\\n2023. This guidance includes approximately $0.9 billion lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the\\nestimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2024.\\n\\u2022 This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal\\nsettlements are concluded.\\n31Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the\\nmarket values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth\\nbelow and in Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\u2014\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\\u201d\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our\\nlong-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements.\\nHowever, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of\\ninterest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.\\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term\\nmarketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely\\naffected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in\\nmarket value due to changes in interest rates.

See Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\\n\\u2014 Note 6 \\u2014 Debt\\u201d for additional information.\\n32Foreign Exchange Risk\\nDuring 2023, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and\\nrelated expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in\\nour North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily\\ninclude Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances\\nassociated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon\\nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and\\nwe may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net\\nsales increased by $88 million in comparison with the prior year.\\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\\u201cforeign\\nfunds\\u201d). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2023, of $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20%\\nadverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.2 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.7 billion.\\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on\\nthe intercompany balances as of December 31, 2023, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates\\nwould result in losses of $320 million, $640 million, and $1.3 billion, recorded to \\u201cOther income (expense), net.\\u201d\\nSee Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\u2014\\nResults of Operations \\u2014 Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates\\u201d for additional information on the effect on reported results of\\nchanges in foreign exchange rates.\\nEquity Investment Risk\\nAs of December 31, 2023, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and\\nprivate companies was $9.6 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our\\nequity investment in Rivian, represent $5.7 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023, and are recorded at fair value,\\nwhich is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and\\nadjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private\\ncompanies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic\\nconditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\\nthe financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for\\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\\nprinciples.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to\\nexpress an opinion on the Company\\u2019s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to\\nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates\\nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that\\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to\\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\\nsubjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the\\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\n35Uncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income\\nthe Matter taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are\\nmany tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment\\nis required in evaluating the Company\\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The\\nCompany uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position\\u2019s technical merits are more\\nlikely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $5.2 billion for various tax\\ncontingencies.\\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company\\u2019s tax contingencies was challenging because\\nthe evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the\\nbenefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management\\u2019s\\nevaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted\\nby regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity.\\nHow We We tested controls over the Company\\u2019s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies,\\nAddressed the including controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained;\\nMatter in Our the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the\\nAudit development of the related disclosures.\\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in\\nassessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\\u2019s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the\\nspecific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our\\nprocedures included obtaining and examining the Company\\u2019s analysis including the Company\\u2019s\\ncorrespondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions\\nare based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income\\ntax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company\\u2019s accounting for its tax\\ncontingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential\\neffects on the Company\\u2019s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the\\nappropriateness of the Company\\u2019s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company\\u2019s calculations and data\\nused to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We evaluated the Company\\u2019s income tax\\ndisclosures in relation to these matters.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company\\u2019s auditor since 1996.\\nSeattle,

financial statements.\\n41AMAZON.COM, INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNote 1 \\u2014 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\\nDescription of Business\\nWe seek to be Earth\\u2019s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets,\\nconsisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers\\nthrough our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to\\ngrow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors,\\nindependent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell\\ncontent. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology\\nservices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and\\nsell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through\\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See \\u201cNote 10 \\u2014\\nSegment Information.\\u201d\\nCommon Stock Split\\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of\\nauthorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (\\u201cRSU\\u201d), and per share or per RSU information throughout\\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a\\npar value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split\\nwas reclassified from \\u201cAdditional paid-in capital\\u201d to \\u201cCommon stock.\\u201d\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. \\u201cOther assets\\u201d were\\nreclassified out of \\u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities\\n(collectively, the \\u201cCompany\\u201d), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable\\ninterest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our\\nhealth care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated\\nentities are eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives\\nof equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation\\nforfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and\\noperating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video\\ncontent. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2023 we completed a useful life study\\nfor our servers and are increasing the useful life from five years to six years in January 2024, which, based on servers that are\\nincluded in \\u201cProperty and equipment, net\\u201d as of December 31, 2023, will have an anticipated impact to our 2024 operating\\nincome of $3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from four years to five years in January 2022.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $1.1 billion, of which $720 million was recorded in\\nthe fourth quarter, of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These\\ncharges were recorded in \\u201cOther operating expense (income), net\\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily\\nimpacted our North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded expenses of approximately\\n$480 million, primarily in \\u201cFulfillment\\u201d, on our consolidated statements of operations primarily relating to terminating\\ncontracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North\\nAmerica segment.\\n42For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $720 million, of which $640 million was recorded in\\nthe fourth quarter, of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded\\nprimarily in \\u201cTechnology and infrastructure,\\u201d \\u201cFulfillment,\\u201d and \\u201cGeneral and administrative\\u201d on our consolidated statements\\nof operations and primarily impacted our North America segment.\\nCharges for impairment, expenses for terminating contracts and other commitments, and severance costs were not\\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023.\\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\\nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\\nCash paid for interest on debt, net of capitalized interest $ 1,098 $ 1,561 $ 2,608\\nCash paid for operating leases $ 6,722 $ 8,633 $ 10,453\\nCash paid for interest on finance leases $ 521 $ 374 $ 308\\nCash paid for interest on financing obligations $ 153 $ 207 $ 196\\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 3,688 $ 6,035 $ 11,179\\nAssets acquired under operating leases $ 25,369 $ 18,800 $ 14,052\\nProperty and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and\\nmodifications $ 7,061 $ 675 $ 642\\nProperty and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit lease\\narrangements $ 5,846 $ 3,187 $ 357\\nProperty and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit lease\\narrangements, with the associated leases recognized as operating $ 230 $ 5,158 $ 1,374\\nEarnings Per Share\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share\\nis calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as\\ndetermined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our\\ncalculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 10,117 10,189 10,304\\nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 179 \\u2014 188\\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 10,296 10,189 10,492\\nRevenue\\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return\\nallowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties,\\nincluding sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is\\nallocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone\\nselling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of\\nthe goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an\\nAmazon delivery, to the customer.\\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders\\nusing our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and\\nshipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon\\ndelivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\\n43Advertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through\\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the\\nnumber of clicks or impressions.\\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to\\ncontent including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime\\nmemberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation.\\nSubscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized\\nover the subscription period.\\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is\\nallocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based\\non the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including\\ncompute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales\\ncommissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video\\ncontent, health care services, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when\\ncontent is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\\nReturn Allowances\\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for\\nreturn allowances are included in \\u201cAccrued expenses and other\\u201d and were $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.4 billion as of\\nDecember 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were $5.1 billion, $5.5 billion, and $5.2 billion and deductions\\nfrom the allowance were $4.9 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.1 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Included in \\u201cInventories\\u201d on our\\nconsolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $882 million, $948 million, and $992 million as of December 31, 2021, 2022,\\nand 2023, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\\nCost of Sales\\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs,\\nincluding costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media\\ncontent costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers\\nare included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and\\nrelated transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in \\u201cFulfillment\\u201d on our consolidated\\nstatements of operations.\\nVendor Agreements\\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions,\\nincentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we\\npay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost\\nof services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We\\nevaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates\\ncan be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\\nFulfillment\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International\\nsegments\\u2019 fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such\\nas depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories;\\npicking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including\\ncosts associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain\\nmanagement for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us\\nin fulfillment and customer service operations.\\n44Technology and Infrastructure\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and\\ndevelopment of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and\\ndisplay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include\\nservers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses\\nnecessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to\\noffer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy\\ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service\\nand autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and infrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and\\nselling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer\\nreferrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third\\nparties.\\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $16.9\\nbillion, $20.6 billion, and $20.3 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related\\nexpenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant\\nand recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares\\ngranted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of\\nestimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is\\nrecognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated\\nmethod also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life,\\nthe adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The\\nestimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated\\nestimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates\\nare revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant\\nyear and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle\\nin cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or\\nexpiration.\\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets, and asset impairments\\nfor physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nMarketable equity securities valuation gains (losses) $ 11,526 $ (13,870) $ 984\\nEquity warrant valuation gains (losses) 1,315 (2,132) 26\\nUpward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies 1,866 76 40\\nForeign currency gains (losses) (55) (340) 65\\nOther, net (19) (540) (177)\\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 14,633 $ (16,806) $ 938\\n45Included in other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(12.7)\\nbillion and $797 million from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (\\u201cRivian\\u201d). Our investment in Rivian\\u2019s\\npreferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian\\u2019s\\ninitial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As\\nof December 31, 2023, we held 158 million shares of Rivian\\u2019s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16%\\nownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant\\ninfluence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and\\njointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian\\u2019s board of directors. We elected the fair value\\noption to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in \\u201cMarketable securities\\u201d on our consolidated balance\\nsheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The investment\\nwas subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022.\\nRequired summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in\\nmillions):\\nYear Ended Year Ended Nine Months Ended\\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2023\\nRevenues $ 55 $ 1,658 $ 3,119\\nGross profit (465) (3,123) (1,424)\\nLoss from operations (4,220) (6,856) (4,158)\\nNet loss (4,688) (6,752) (3,911)\\nDecember 31, 2022 September 30, 2023\\nTotal current assets $ 13,130 $ 12,086\\nTotal assets 17,876 16,456\\nTotal current liabilities 2,424 2,624\\nTotal liabilities 4,077 5,904\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and\\nlosses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We\\nintend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely\\noutside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such\\namounts.\\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and\\nliabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates\\nexpected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are\\nevaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We\\nconsider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative\\nloss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods\\navailable to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies).\\nThe first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is\\nmore likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The\\nsecond step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate\\nsettlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require\\nperiodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our\\nincome tax contingencies in income tax expense.\\n46Fair Value of Financial Instruments\\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly\\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the\\nfollowing hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\\nLevel 1 \\u2014 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 \\u2014 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted\\nprices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities\\nin markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\\nLevel 3 \\u2014 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably\\navailable assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in\\nactive markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of\\nsecurities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from\\nor corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3\\nassets as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023,\\nthese warrants had a fair value of $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, and are recorded within \\u201cOther assets\\u201d on our consolidated\\nbalance sheets with gains and losses recognized in \\u201cOther income (expense), net\\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nThese warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and\\nare valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently\\navailable information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product\\nvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance,\\nrepresenting a write-down of inventory, was $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers\\u2019 programs. Third-party sellers\\nmaintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and\\ntherefore these products are not included in our inventories.\\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to\\nprovide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead\\ntimes and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain\\nelectronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These\\ncommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We\\nalso have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\\nIncluded in \\u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to\\ncustomers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023,\\ncustomer receivables, net, were $26.6 billion and $34.1 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $6.9 billion and $8.5 billion, seller\\nreceivables, net, were $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, and other receivables, net, were $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion. Seller\\nreceivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to\\nprocure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $4.5 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and\\nDecember 31, 2023.\\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses.\\nReceivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected\\nin accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.7\\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were $1.0 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion,\\nand deductions to the allowance were $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\\n47Software Development Costs\\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use\\nsoftware, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs,\\nincluding those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.\\nProperty and Equipment, Net\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from\\nproperty and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own,\\nalong with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the\\nconstruction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment,\\nheavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the\\nestimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, four years\\nprior to January 1, 2022 and five years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our servers, five years prior to January 1, 2022 and six\\nyears subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for\\nother fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense\\ncategories on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nLeases\\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are\\ngenerally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired\\nunder finance leases are recorded in \\u201cProperty and equipment, net.\\u201d All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our\\nleases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.\\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of\\nproperty, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are\\naccounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone\\nprices.\\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a\\ndiscount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present\\nvalue of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease\\nprepayments reclassified from \\u201cOther assets\\u201d upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and\\namortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.\\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase\\nthe leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the\\nclassification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes\\nin price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the\\nterm of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the\\nestimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term.\\nThe interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method\\nover the lease term.\\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the\\ntermination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded\\nliabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\\nFinancing Obligations\\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have\\ncontrol over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the\\narrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful\\nlife or the term of the obligation.\\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are\\nderecognized, and we classify the lease as operating.\\n48Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event\\noccurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative\\nassessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset\\nis less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and\\nindefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value,\\nwe recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash\\nflows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily\\non expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible\\nassets as of April 1, 2023, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their\\ncarrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See \\u201cNote 5 \\u2014 Acquisitions,\\nGoodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.\\u201d\\nOther Assets\\nIncluded in \\u201cOther assets\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content,\\nnet of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization;\\nequity warrant assets and certain equity investments; satellite network launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans.\\nWe recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the\\nagreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These\\nincentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.\\nDigital Video and Music Content\\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing\\nagreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the\\nlicense fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we\\nrecognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we\\namortize the asset to \\u201cCost of sales\\u201d on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line\\nbasis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are\\nexpensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to\\n\\u201cCost of sales\\u201d predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content.\\nThe weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years. We review usage and viewing patterns\\nimpacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each\\nmajor geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an\\nevent occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of\\nvideo, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $16.7 billion and $17.4 billion.\\nTotal video and music expense was $16.6 billion and $18.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Total video\\nand music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships,\\nand costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\\nInvestments\\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term\\nmarketable debt securities. Such investments are included in \\u201cCash and cash equivalents\\u201d or \\u201cMarketable securities\\u201d on the\\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.\\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses\\nincluded in \\u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\\u201d Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair\\nvalue below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a\\nforecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through \\u201cOther income (expense), net\\u201d on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\nConvertible notes classified as available for sale, equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the\\nability to exercise significant influence and accounted for at cost, and equity investments accounted for using the equity method\\nof accounting are included within \\u201cOther assets\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.\\n49In Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. The note is\\nclassified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in \\u201cAccumulated other\\ncomprehensive income (loss).\\u201d The note is classified as a Level 3 asset. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest\\nup to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the\\nprovision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips.\\nEquity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are\\naccounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in \\u201cOther\\nincome (expense), net\\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative\\nassessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and\\ntrends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we\\nwrite it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $715\\nmillion and $754 million.\\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value\\noption, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the\\nearnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and\\nimpairments, if any, are recognized in \\u201cEquity-method investment activity, net of tax\\u201d on our consolidated statements of\\noperations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary\\nand if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair\\nvalue option, are included in \\u201cMarketable securities\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with\\nchanges recognized in \\u201cOther income (expense), net\\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nLong-Lived Assets\\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever\\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that\\nwould necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a\\nsignificant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate\\nthat the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset\\u2019s carrying\\namount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss\\nbased on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale\\nwhen certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for\\nsale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at\\nthe lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nAccrued Expenses and Other\\nIncluded in \\u201cAccrued expenses and other\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and\\nasset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, current debt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, self-\\ninsurance liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.7 billion and our liabilities for\\nunredeemed gift cards were $5.4 billion and $5.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer.\\nThe portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.\\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\\nAlthough we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-\\ninsure for exposure primarily related to workers\\u2019 compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability,\\nand automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-\\ninsurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development,\\ninflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement\\namounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the\\nfourth quarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily\\ndriven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in \\u201cCost of\\nsales\\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment. Increases to our reserves driven\\nby changes in estimates were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\\n502023. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our total self-insurance liabilities were $4.0 billion and $6.3 billion and are included\\nin \\u201cAccrued expenses and other\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nUnearned Revenue\\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is\\nrecognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime\\nmemberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $16.1 billion, of which $12.4 billion was recognized as\\nrevenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $20.6 billion.\\nIncluded in \\u201cOther long-term liabilities\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.9 billion and $5.7 billion of unearned\\nrevenue as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer\\ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that\\nexceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $155.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average\\nremaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.0 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven\\nby customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\\nIncluded in \\u201cOther long-term liabilities\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing\\nobligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax\\nliabilities.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly\\nincurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that\\neither operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are\\ntranslated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates\\nprevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in \\u201cAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss),\\u201d a\\nseparate component of stockholders\\u2019 equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a\\ncurrency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in \\u201cOther income (expense), net\\u201d on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we\\nrecorded gains (losses) of $19 million, $386 million, and $(329) million in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (\\u201cASU\\u201d)\\namending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the\\neffective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with\\nearly adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to\\ndetermine its impact on our income tax disclosures.\\n51Note 2 \\u2014 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily\\nconsisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade\\nsecurities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value.

These non-income tax controversies typically include (i) the taxability of\\nproducts and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with\\nthird parties, including as a result of evolving requirements imposed on marketplaces with respect to third-party sellers, and (iii)\\nthe adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent\\ncomplexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome\\nof any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:\\nIn November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District\\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas.

In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of\\ndamages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be\\nsubject to $130 million to $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court\\nfor the Northern District of California. In May 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding that the patent is\\ninvalid. In June 2022, Eolas filed a notice of appeal. In February 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal\\nCircuit affirmed the district court\\u2019s judgment.

Attorneys\\nGeneral for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior\\nCourt of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the\\nprivate cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through\\nAmazon\\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The\\ncomplaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties,\\nattorneys\\u2019 fees, and costs.

In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be\\nsubject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment, holding that the\\npatents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal.

We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing\\nand intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\\nBeginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents\\nrelated to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India,\\nthe United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International\\nTrade Commission. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video services and features of\\nAmazon devices carrying the Prime Video app infringe Nokia\\u2019s patents; some of the complaints additionally allege\\ninfringement by Freevee, Twitch, and Amazon voice assistants. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and,\\nin some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys\\u2019 fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These\\nmatters are at various procedural stages, with preliminary injunctions issued in certain instances. We dispute the allegations of\\nwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\\nIn addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory\\nproceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust,\\nprivacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,\\nand other matters.\\n62The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant\\nuncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular\\nbasis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including\\namounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our\\naccruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or\\nrange of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\\nlosses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if\\nany of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the\\namounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or\\ncash flows.\\nSee also \\u201cNote 9 \\u2014 Income Taxes.\\u201d\\nNote 8 \\u2014 STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY\\nPreferred Stock\\nWe have authorized 500 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock.

These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase\\nout annually from 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated depreciation deduction election\\nfor 2021, and a full election for 2022 and 2023.

This regime is\\nreferred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and is dependent on the amount of our U.S. taxable\\nincome.\\nWe generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a\\ndecrease in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction. This was partially offset by a reduction in excess\\ntax benefits from stock-based compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline\\nin the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions. The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022\\nreflects a change in our application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes a tax\\nbenefit of approximately $655 million related to years prior to 2022.\\n65We recorded a provision for income taxes in 2023 as compared to an income tax benefit in 2022 primarily due to an\\nincrease in pretax income, a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects\\nof corporate restructuring transactions, and an increase in tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation. This was partially\\noffset by an increase in federal research and development credits, which included approximately $600 million of tax benefit\\nrecorded in 2023 related to a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 U.S. federal R&D credit.\\nWe intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries,\\nindefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of\\nsuch amounts.\\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2022 2023\\nDeferred tax assets (1):\\nLoss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States 386 610\\nLoss carryforwards - Foreign 2,831 2,796\\nAccrued liabilities, reserves, and other expenses 3,280 3,751\\nStock-based compensation 4,295 5,279\\nDepreciation and amortization 1,009 1,114\\nOperating lease liabilities 18,285 19,922\\nCapitalized research and development 6,824 14,800\\nOther items 1,023 745\\nTax credits 950 1,582\\nTotal gross deferred tax assets 38,883 50,599\\nLess valuation allowances (2) (4,374) (4,811)\\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 34,509 45,788\\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\nDepreciation and amortization (9,039) (12,454)\\nOperating lease assets (17,140) (18,648)\\nOther items (817) (1,489)\\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances $ 7,513 $ 13,197\\n___________________\\n(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.\\n(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign\\ntaxing jurisdictions or future capital gains, as well as tax credits.\\nOur valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net\\noperating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023.

If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2024.\\nIncome Tax Contingencies\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is\\nrequired in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business,\\nthere are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-\\nrelated uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are\\nestablished when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully\\nsupportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The\\nprovision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.\\n66The reconciliation of our income tax contingencies is as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nGross tax contingencies \\u2013 January 1 $ 2,820 $ 3,242 $ 4,002\\nGross increases to tax positions in prior periods 403 274 440\\nGross decreases to tax positions in prior periods (354) (172) (38)\\nGross increases to current period tax positions 507 706 1,009\\nSettlements with tax authorities (60) (20) (106)\\nLapse of statute of limitations (74) (28) (79)\\nGross tax contingencies \\u2013 December 31 (1) $ 3,242 $ 4,002 $ 5,228\\n___________________\\n(1) As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $5.2 billion of income tax contingencies of which $3.3 billion, if fully\\nrecognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to\\ntax contingencies of $103 million and $194 million.

These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net\\noperating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods.\\nWe are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India,\\nJapan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional\\nassessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are\\ncurrently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of\\nincome.\\nIn September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (\\u201cLTA\\u201d) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we\\ndistributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this\\nmatter. We believe the LTA\\u2019s position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect\\nto recoup taxes paid.\\nThe Indian tax authority (\\u201cITA\\u201d) has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will\\nneed to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe\\nthe ITA\\u2019s position is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup\\ntaxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes\\npreviously paid.\\nIn October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax\\nauthorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European\\nUnion rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax\\nauthorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision, the European\\nCommission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \\u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006\\nthrough June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to\\nrecovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission\\u2019s decision, which we\\ndeposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg\\nappealed the European Commission\\u2019s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General\\nCourt annulled the European Commission\\u2019s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to\\nthe European Court of Justice. In December 2023, the European Court of Justice affirmed the European Union General Court\\u2019s\\ndecision.\\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax\\ncontingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and\\nregulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the\\namounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts\\naccrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax\\nauthorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or\\nsettlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\\u2019 tax filings. The actual amount of any\\nchange could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an\\nestimate of the range of possible outcomes.\\n67Note 10 \\u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment\\nresults the operating expenses \\u201cFulfillment,\\u201d \\u201cTechnology and infrastructure,\\u201d \\u201cSales and marketing,\\u201d and \\u201cGeneral and\\nadministrative\\u201d based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of\\ntechnology costs recorded in \\u201cTechnology and infrastructure\\u201d are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America\\nand AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in \\u201cTechnology and infrastructure\\u201d are allocated to the AWS\\nsegment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating\\ndecision maker (\\u201cCODM\\u201d) regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated\\noperating income (loss) by segment.

Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nWe carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \\u201c1934 Act\\u201d), under the supervision\\nand with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and\\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2023.\\nBased on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31,\\n2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be\\ndisclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within\\nthe time periods specified in the SEC\\u2019s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is\\naccumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as\\nappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nManagement\\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined\\nin Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as\\nof December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control \\u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded\\nthat, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting and its report is included below.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that\\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Controls\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable\\nassurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls\\nand procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no\\nmatter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\\nassurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements\\ndue to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been\\ndetected.\\n71Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders\\nAmazon.com, Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Amazon.com, Inc.\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\\nestablished in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\\nCommission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all\\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\\nstatements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the\\nperiod ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion\\nthereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company\\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\\u2019s Report\\non Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\u2019s internal control\\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\\nmaintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a\\nmaterial weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed\\nrisk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides\\na reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\\naccepted accounting principles. A company\\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the company\\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSeattle, Washington\\nFebruary 1, 2024\\n72Item 9B.
